# Forest MIR: A Musical Interaction Between Robots and Live Musicians

Breathe is a live performance that explores the interaction between robots and musicians, inspired by the forest of Vrindavan, where Lord Krishna spent most of his childhood. The piece showcases how, through the power of music, Lord Krishna was able to communicate with the entire forest and bring it to life.

## Concept

In this performance, robots come alive to the music and interact with live musicians. The robots listen and respond to the melody, harmony, and rhythm of the performers, singing and dancing along with them. The technology behind this project involves real-time pitch and beat detection, which trigger different movements and sounds.

Performers:
- Nitin Hugar, flute
- Nikhil Ravi Krishnan, drum

Creators:
- Nitin Hugar
- Hardik Goel
- Daniel Pilipenko
